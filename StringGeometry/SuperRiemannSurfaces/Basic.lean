# Super Riemann Surfaces

A super Riemann surface (SRS) is a (1|1)-dimensional complex supermanifold
with additional structure: a maximally non-integrable rank (0|1) distribution
in the tangent bundle.

This is the worldsheet geometry for superstring theory. The moduli space
of super Riemann surfaces is crucial for computing superstring amplitudes.

## Main definitions

* `SuperRiemannSurface` - A (1|1) complex supermanifold with superconformal structure
* `SuperconformalDistribution` - The rank (0|1) distribution D with [D, D] = T/D
* `SuperconformalMap` - Maps preserving the superconformal structure
* `SuperModuliSpace` - The moduli space of SRS of given genus

## The key constraint

A super Riemann surface is NOT just any (1|1) complex supermanifold.
The crucial additional structure is a rank (0|1) subbundle D ⊂ TM such that:

  [D, D] = TM/D   (as a map D ⊗ D → TM/D)

In local coordinates (z|θ), we can choose D = span{D_θ} where:
  D_θ = ∂/∂θ + θ ∂/∂z

This is the "standard" superconformal structure. The constraint [D,D] = TM/D
means D_θ² = ∂/∂z (up to a factor), which is the key equation.

## The relationship between superconformal structure and spin structure

The superconformal distribution D determines (and is determined by) a spin
structure on the reduced surface Σ_red:

1. **D restricted to Σ_red**: When we restrict D to the reduced surface
   (setting θ = 0), we get a line bundle L on Σ_red.

2. **L is a spin bundle**: The constraint [D, D] = T/D implies that
   L ⊗ L ≅ K (the canonical bundle), so L = K^{1/2} is a spin structure.

3. **Conversely**: Given a Riemann surface Σ with spin structure K^{1/2},
   we can construct a "minimal" super Riemann surface by taking the
   split supermanifold (Σ, Λ•(K^{1/2})*) with the canonical D.

This establishes a fundamental correspondence:
  { Super Riemann surfaces } ←→ { Riemann surfaces with spin structure }

The non-trivial part is that the supermoduli space 𝔐_g is generally NOT
the same as the "split" construction - there exist SRS that are not
isomorphic to any split model (non-projectedness, Donagi-Witten).

## Superconformal transformations

A superconformal map preserves D. In coordinates:
  z' = f(z) + θ η(z) ψ(z)
  θ' = ψ(z) + θ η(z)

where f is holomorphic and the superconformal constraint requires f' = η².

## Super Riemann Surfaces

A super Riemann surface (SRS) is a (1|1)-dimensional complex supermanifold
with additional structure: a maximally non-integrable odd distribution D.

### Key Components (following Witten "Notes on Super Riemann Surfaces")

1. **Reduced surface**: The body Σ_red is an ordinary Riemann surface
2. **Spin structure**: A square root of the canonical bundle K^{1/2}
3. **Odd distribution**: D ⊂ TM with rank (0|1) and [D, D] = TM/D

The spin structure is essential: the superconformal structure determines
a spin structure on the reduced surface, and conversely a Riemann surface
with spin structure can be "thickened" to a super Riemann surface.

/-- A spin structure on a Riemann surface is a square root of the canonical bundle.
    For a genus g surface, there are 2^{2g} spin structures, classified by their
    parity (even or odd) determined by h⁰(K^{1/2}) mod 2.

    In the context of super Riemann surfaces, the spin structure determines the
    fermion boundary conditions: Neveu-Schwarz (antiperiodic) or Ramond (periodic). -/

/-- The Arf invariant of a spin structure (0 for even, 1 for odd).

    The Arf invariant is a Z/2Z-valued topological invariant that classifies
    spin structures into two types. It equals the dimension of the space of
    holomorphic sections of K^{1/2} modulo 2:
      Arf(L) = h⁰(L) mod 2

    Properties:
    - Arf = 0 for even spin structures (more common: 2^{g-1}(2^g + 1) of them)
    - Arf = 1 for odd spin structures (less common: 2^{g-1}(2^g - 1) of them)
    - The Arf invariant is additive under tensor product of spin structures -/
def SpinStructureData.arfInvariant (s : SpinStructureData) : Fin 2 :=
  if s.parity = RiemannSurfaces.SpinParity.even then 0 else 1

/-- The superconformal distribution D on a super Riemann surface.

    This is the key structure that distinguishes a super Riemann surface from
    a generic (1|1)-supermanifold. The distribution D is:
    - A rank (0|1) subbundle of the tangent sheaf TM
    - Maximally non-integrable: [D, D] = TM/D (the Frobenius bracket generates the quotient)

    In local superconformal coordinates (z|θ), D is generated by:
      D_θ = ∂/∂θ + θ ∂/∂z

    The constraint [D, D] = TM/D is equivalent to D_θ² = ∂/∂z (up to a function factor).

    ### Connection to spin structure

    When restricted to the reduced surface (θ = 0), the distribution D becomes
    a line bundle on Σ_red. The constraint [D, D] = TM/D implies this line bundle
    squares to the tangent bundle T, hence D|_{Σ_red} = K^{-1/2} = (K^{1/2})*.
    Dually, D* restricted to Σ_red gives the spin bundle K^{1/2}. -/

/-- A super Riemann surface is a (1|1)-dimensional complex supermanifold
    with a superconformal structure.

    ### Mathematical Definition

    A super Riemann surface (SRS) of genus g is a complex supermanifold M of dimension (1|1)
    equipped with:

    1. **Body**: A topological space M_red (the reduced space, a Riemann surface of genus g)
    2. **Structure sheaf**: O_M, a sheaf of supercommutative ℂ-algebras locally isomorphic to
       O_Σ ⊕ L for a line bundle L on M_red
    3. **Superconformal distribution**: D ⊂ TM, a rank (0|1) odd distribution satisfying:
       - D is locally generated by one odd vector field
       - The Frobenius bracket satisfies [D, D] = TM/D (maximal non-integrability)

    ### The Superconformal Constraint

    The constraint [D, D] = TM/D is the defining equation of a super Riemann surface.
    In local superconformal coordinates (z|θ), the distribution D is generated by:
      D_θ = ∂/∂θ + θ ∂/∂z
    and the constraint is equivalent to D_θ² = ∂/∂z.

    This constraint:
    - Determines the superconformal structure (there is no extra choice)
    - Implies that the transition functions preserve D, hence are superconformal
    - Forces the line bundle D|_{M_red} to satisfy D ⊗ D ≅ T_{M_red} = K⁻¹
    - Therefore D|_{M_red} ≅ K^{-1/2} and its dual is a spin structure K^{1/2}

    ### Relation to Spin Structures

    The superconformal structure determines a spin structure on the reduced
    surface Σ_red: the line bundle D restricted to Σ_red is K^{-1/2}, whose dual
    K^{1/2} is the spin bundle. Conversely, every spin structure on a Riemann
    surface gives rise to a "split" super Riemann surface (Σ, Λ•(K^{1/2})*).

    ### Formalization Approach

    We bundle:
    - The body (underlying topological space)
    - The genus (a topological invariant of the reduced surface)
    - The spin structure data (parity: even or odd)
    - Abstract structure sheaf and chart data

    The superconformal distribution D and the constraint [D, D] = TM/D are implicit
    in the structure - they would be recovered from the explicit chart transition
    functions in a full formalization. -/

## The Spin Structure - Superconformal Structure Correspondence

The fundamental relationship between spin structures and superconformal structures:

### From superconformal to spin

Given a super Riemann surface with superconformal distribution D:
1. Restrict D to the reduced surface Σ_red (set θ = 0)
2. D|_{Σ_red} is a line bundle L on Σ_red
3. The constraint [D, D] = TM/D implies L² ≅ T_{Σ_red} = K⁻¹
4. Therefore L ≅ K^{-1/2}, and L* ≅ K^{1/2} is a spin structure

### From spin to superconformal (split case)

Given a Riemann surface Σ with spin structure S = K^{1/2}:
1. Form the split supermanifold M = (Σ, Λ•S*)
2. The structure sheaf is O_M = O_Σ ⊕ S*
3. D is generated by the canonical odd derivation

This gives the "split" or "projected" super Riemann surface associated to (Σ, S).

### Non-split super Riemann surfaces

Not every super Riemann surface is split! This is the content of the
Donagi-Witten theorem: for g ≥ 5, the supermoduli space 𝔐_g contains
super Riemann surfaces that are not isomorphic to any split model.
-/

/-- The restriction of the distribution D to the reduced surface.

    When we restrict D ⊂ TM to the reduced surface Σ_red (by setting θ = 0),
    we obtain a line bundle D|_{Σ_red} on Σ_red.

    The key property: D|_{Σ_red} ⊗ D|_{Σ_red} ≅ T_{Σ_red} = K⁻¹

    This means D|_{Σ_red} ≅ K^{-1/2}, and dually (D|_{Σ_red})* ≅ K^{1/2}
    is the spin bundle determined by the superconformal structure. -/
